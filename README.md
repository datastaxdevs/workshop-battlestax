Welcome to **BattleStax**, an online party game that you can enjoy with your friends. BattleStax is implemented as a [JAMStack](https://jamstack.org/) app that uses [Stargate](https://stargate.io), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/jamstack/), [Astra](https://dtsx.io/workshop), and [GitHub](https://github.com/) to demonstrate how to build and deploy an application using modern, scalable architectures. 

In this 3 hour workshop you will create your own **BattleStax** game using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) implemented with a CI/CD pipeline, global CDN network, and [Apache Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/) all using **FREE** tech.
